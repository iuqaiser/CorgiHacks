                    <h1>Welcome to Corgi!</h1>
                    <p>Corgis are the royalty that rises above the rest of the canine nobility of the world. From their short statures to their vibrant coats, they are truly perfection personified. The author cannot say they know this from personal experience due the unfortunate affliction of allergic asthma, but the superiority of corgis is not something one confirms with their own experiences, but is a fact that they know, in their hearts.</p>
                    <p>On this humble memorial to the majesty of the elegant corgi, you will find a quiz to prove your competency of existing within the same multiverse as corgis, as well as other wonderful corgi-related things. Consult the navigation bar above for more.</p>
